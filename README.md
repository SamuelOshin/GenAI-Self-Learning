# 🧠 GenAI Pinnacle+ Learning Journey by Samuel Oshin

Welcome to my hands-on learning journey through the **Generative AI Pinnacle+ curriculum** — an open-source, project-based roadmap inspired by Analytics Vidhya's GenAI program.

This repo documents my weekly progress, projects, and reflections as I learn how to **build, prompt, and deploy modern AI systems** like chatbots, agents, RAG apps, and self-correcting tools.
